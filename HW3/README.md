# Supercollider and OSC Protocol
The goal of this project is to develop an innovative digital musical instrument and based on an additive synthesis synthesizer, as well as a unique interface to control it. 
The user uploads an image, which is displayed; the user then moves the cursor on the image. 
Each time a different pixel is selected, a chord based on the color and tonality of that particular pixel is generated and played back. 
A use case for this instruments would be, for example, an interactive website experience, perhaps with a ”cover size” background image; or an artistic installation at a particular venue.
